        <p>
          I'm an aspiring software developer with a passion for exploring the vast 
          possibilities of programming. I've been coding since I was 12, starting 
          with small games in Python and evolving into a diverse range of projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          My experience spans from creating virtual assistants and VR applications 
          to developing shaders and procedurally generated visuals. I'm driven by 
          a love for technology and a desire to learn, create, and solve complex 
          problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm proficient in Python, C++, JavaScript, and C#, with Python being my 
          strongest language.
